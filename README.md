A professional Wordpress website for 602SouthWest Photography

Showcasing a Wordpress Website and Benefits for a Local Business

http://602southwest.wordpress.com

How I designed the site
- removed comment box in bottom of pages to more resemble a website rather than a blog
- added an instagram widget linked to the 602SouthWest Instagram account, displaying the 2 most recent images posted.
- facebook like box added: connecting social media page of 602SouthWest to the website. 
- changed landing page to link to the "about" page; an overview of the business
- added two mosaic albums in the collections page displaying previous images works
- header image is randomized between multiple images (all images same size)
- added custom background image,
