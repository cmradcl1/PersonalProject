CIS 440 Personal Project
===============
Task: 
--------------
Build a professional Wordpress website for 602SouthWest Photography showcasing what iâ€™ve learned from about building a website using Wordpress.

Site Address: http://www.602southwest.com

Explination
-------------
For my group project, our client was SkyTouch Technologies and after solidifying what they wanted, my group and I were able to dig into Wordpress to better understand how it works and its features. Prior to our client selecting wordpress, our group had minimal experience using it (personally I had none).

Therefore, for my personal project I chose to design and implement an entirely new website for another business. I wanted to be able to showcase how i've gone from knowing nothing of wordpress to successfully producing a website and design that is effective from scratch.

Design
-------------
A clean, professional looking site that is minimalistic, yet informative enough to engage viewers.

Steps Taken:
- used a simple metal-styled background image to breakup monotony of a solid color background. It is formatted for all sized screens to prevent distortion, overlap, or repetition of the image itself.
- rotating header images between 3 different photos for variety as clients view the site.
- usual blog landing page removed and diverted to the "about" page of 602SouthWest. (wanted to make it feel more like a website than blog).
- pages for each of the photographers including images and a short bio to make the viewer or potential client more connected.
- collections page has a copy of the current logo and a quote.
- 3 style of collection sub-pages created so they fall under the tab when you hover on the menu. They're ordered by priority, automive being first as it is most likely to be clicked on and the prominent style of work 602SouthWest does.
- Collection sub-pages include mosaic tiled media galleries that popup as you click on them. This allows wordpress users to comment on the photos if they choose to, and it allows a slideshow of all the photos in that collection. The order of the images in the mosaics are randomized to keep the website fresh. 
- contact us page includes email, facebook and instagram links.
- contact us email form added to contact page for ease of inquiring, linked to the 602southwest@gmail.com email account. 
- removed comment box in bottom of pages to more resemble a website rather than a blog.
- added an instagram widget linked to the 602SouthWest Instagram account that will be displaying the 2 most recent images posted. widget is set to be present on every page of the website.
- facebook like box added as a widget that will be present on every page of the website. goal of this was that if we can get potential clients to "like" 602SouthWest on facebook, we have a greater precentage of receiving their business.
